CS411 - 01

Kristi Chang

Create an app with two views. The first initial view will allow the user to enter in a dollar amount, discount rate,
additional discount rate, and sales tax to calculate and visualize the cost of an item. A second view will show
the user a graphical breakdown of the costs. The user with a swipe gesture can move from one view to
another.
